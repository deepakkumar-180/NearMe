        <h1>Thirumalai Nayakkar Mahal</h1>
        <p>Tirumala Nayaka (reigned 1623â€“16 February 1659) was the ruler of Madurai 
            Nayak Dynasty in the 17th century. He ruled Madurai between 1623 and 
            1659. His contributions are found in the many splendid buildings and 
            temples of Madurai. He belongs to Balija caste.[3] His kingdom was 
            under constant threat from the armies of Bijapur Sultanate and the other 
            neighbouring Muslim kingdoms, which he managed to repulse successfully. His 
            territories comprised much of the old Pandya territories which included Coimbatore, 
            Tirunelveli, Madurai districts, Aragalur in southern Tamil Nadu and some territories 
            of the Travancore kingdom.</p>
