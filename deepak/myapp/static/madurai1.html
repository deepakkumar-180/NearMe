        <h1>MEENAKSHI AMMAN TEMPLE</h1>
        <p>Madurai Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple was built by Pandyan Emperor Sadayavarman Kulasekaran I (r. 1190–1216). 
            He built the main portions of the three-storeyed Gopuram at the entrance of Sundareswarar Shrine and 
            the central portion of the Goddess Meenakshi Shrine, which are some of the earliest surviving parts of the temple. 
            The traditional texts call him a poet-saint king, additionally credit him with a poem called Ambikai Malai, 
            as well as shrines (koil) each for Natarajar and Surya near the main temple, Ayyanar in the east, Vinayagar in the south, 
            Kariamalperumal in the west and Kali in the north. He also built a Mahamandapam. Kulasekara Pandya was also a poet and 
            he composed a poem on Meenakshi named Ambikai Malai.[9] Maravarman Sundara Pandyan I built a gopuram in 1231, then called 
            Avanivendaraman, later rebuilt, expanded and named as Sundara Pandya Thirukkopuram.[9] Chitra gopuram (W), also known as
            Muttalakkum Vayil, was built by Maravarman Sundara Pandyan II (1238-1251). This gopuram is named after the frescoes
            and reliefs that depict secular and religious themes of Hindu culture. Maravarman Sundara Pandyan II also added a
            pillared corridor to the Sundareswara shrine and the Sundara Pandyan Mandapam.[9] It was rebuilt after the 14th-century
            damage, its granite structure was renovated by Kumara Krishnappar after 1595.[10]</p>
